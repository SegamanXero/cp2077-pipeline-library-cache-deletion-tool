## About
I created this as a way of quickly deleting the pipeline library cache for Cyberpunk 2077. For some reason I am subjecting myself to the abuse of trying to run this game on a older PC running Windows 7 that has no business running this game that is already a dumpsterfire to run.

If deleting this cache file helps with making the game work for you, then this is a easy tool that makes that process quicker if you delete it frequently.

## Setup
To use this batch file place it where ever you like. Executing the file will ask you if you wish to delete the cache or not. Saying no terminates the tool, and saying yes attempts to delete the cache file respectively.
